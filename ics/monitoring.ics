DESCRIPTION:When to use what monitoring service\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nAzure provides a bunch of services for monitoring purposes. So, when should you use what service? If you want to know what options you have, this session is for you!\nToni is giving an overview of the services and is diving into the monitoring services, showing samples, what benefits various services have, and when you should use what. Of course, with using such services comes a little bit of Azure management, governance, and best practices. Start with monitoring various workloads and get insights into your services and apps with the Azure cloud services.\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://www.globalazure.at/sessions/monitoring
