DESCRIPTION:Web API Security With Azure Active Directory\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nGetting started with Azure Active Directory (AAD) can be a bit confusing. Flows, app registrations, service principals, redirect URIs, scopes, client IDs vs. object IDs - the sheer number of concepts you have to be familiar with scares many people away. With his session, Rainer would like to bring some clarity into the auth jungle of AAD. He will not show slides. Instead, he will build an end-to-end application with Angular in the front-end and .NET 5 in the back-end. Rainer will demonstrate how AAD can be used to protect all application layers. On your way through the sample, you will learn about important concepts of AAD.\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://globalazure.at/sessions/inside-aad
