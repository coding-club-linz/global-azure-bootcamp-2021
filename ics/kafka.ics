DESCRIPTION:Four Different Ways of Working with Kafka on Azure\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nLife doesn't happen in batch mode, which is why for several years now, we see a very strong tendency towards stream processing throughout various industries. Companies need, or least partially have to rethink their existing data architectures in order to enable near real-time business cases. Besides traditional database systems and batch-driven tooling, many companies put Apache KafkaÂ® - the de facto standard for robust and scalable event streaming - to good use.\n\nThis talk explores the following four different ways to run Kafka on Azure:\n\n* Kafka on HDInsight (open-source core Kafka)\n* EventHubs (Microsoft's very own "Kafka look-alike")\n* Confluent Cloud (a vendor-backed Kafka distribution)\n* Kafka in Azure Kubernetes Service\n\nYou will walk away with a better understanding about the most important benefits, drawbacks and implications for each of the discussed alternatives. \n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://globalazure.at/sessions/kafka
