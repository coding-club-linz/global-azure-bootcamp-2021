DESCRIPTION:Conditional Access & App Controls\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nUse Conditional Access & App Controls enforce rules for cloud apps, devices and further conditional access parameters.\nConditional Access is a basic option to control access to Microsoft 365 services. In addition to parameters such as users, apps or the device used to access, app policies can also be triggered in Conditional Access Policies. For example, depending on whether the user accesses from the company network or not, it can be determined whether the access is web-only or not.\nThe options with this feature are, for example, a very powerful tool in the context of HOME Office to increase security and enforce compliance aspects.\nUsing Conditional Access & App Controls we can create rules for cloud apps, the devices that are used to access those apps and further conditional access parameters.\nIn this session, you will learn how to configure the basic settings using an example with Microsoft Teams and SharePoint. We will go through scenarios such as:\n•	Use app enforced restrictions\n•	Use Conditional Access App Control\n•	Force Sign-in frequency limitations\n•	Persistent browser session settings\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://www.globalazure.at/sessions/conditional-access
