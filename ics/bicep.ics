I use Terraform for years now, but sometimes it can be fun to break a habit ;-)\n\nIn this session we will take look into Azure Bicep and compare it to Hashicorp's popular IaC tool Terraform.\nChosing the right tool, that fits your needs is hard. So let's take a  look into both tools to see which one you can use in your next awesome project.\n\nAdditionally, we will  we discover Bicep hands-on by implementing a simple static website using Azure Storage Account.\n\nThis session requires at least basic knowledge of Infrastructure as code, Terraform and Azure Resource Manager (ARM).\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://globalazure.at/sessions/bicep
