DESCRIPTION:Multi-Cloud Magic: Leveraging Multi-Cloud Clusters in Real-World Scenarios\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nPublic, Private, Hybrid...Multi-Cloud?\n\nAs the cloud development options and architectures continue to evolve, we've finally found ourselves at the next new thing: Multi-Cloud. What is it? Do we really need it? How would you take advantage of a multi-cloud solution? \n\nIn this talk, I'd like to describe a few real-world use cases where a multi-cloud solution is currently in production, specifically when it comes to data. These include:\n\n- Data Sovereignty & Data Residency\n- Varied Client Requirements\n- Developer / Client Choice\n\nA demo on how to setup a multi-cloud cluster will also be shown.\n\nThe audience will leave with a more confident understanding of real-world, multi-cloud use cases and see how to create their own!\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://globalazure.at/sessions/multi-cloud-magic
