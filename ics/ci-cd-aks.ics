DESCRIPTION:Modern continous delivery on Azure Kubernetes Service\nNOTE that date/time is in CEST time zone (UTC +2)\n\n---\n\nContinuous delivery (CD) might be a challenging and daunting task to set up and maintain based on 1000+ lines of pipeline code - but it doesnâ€™t have to be this way. Modern tools can make your application deployment and delivery process an efficient, quick, and sustainable commodity without requiring a lot of configuration.\n\nIn this talk you will learn 1) how to employ new delivery models such as blue/green deployments, and 2) how to integrate quality gates into pipelines to ensure no bad code changes can make it to production. We are going to use the open-source tool Keptn that is based on SRE principles to define delivery and operation workflows and will be doing a live deployment with quality gates on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). \n\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://globalazure.at/sessions/ci-cd-aks
