DESCRIPTION:Welcoming the Quantum Era with Azure Quantum\n\n---\n\nHarnessing the unique behaviour of quantum physics and applying it to computing, quantum computers introduce new concepts to traditional programming methods such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference.\n\nMicrosoft, having a clear mindset towards the coming quantum era, is partnering with quantum hardware companies to provide developers with cloud access to quantum hardware. \n\nLeveraging the Azure Quantum platform and the Q# language, developers are now able to explore quantum algorithms and run their quantum programs on different types of quantum hardware.\n\nIn this session, we will explore Azure Quantumâ€™s capabilities and run a Q# quantum application on a real quantum computer.\n\n---\n\nStreaming URL: https://www.globalazure.at/sessions/quantum
