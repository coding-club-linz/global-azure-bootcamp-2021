                    <i>Global Azure</i> is a 3-day virtual conference in which communities
                    around the world organize live streams to learn about Cloud Computing and Microsoft Azure.
                    This is the Austrian edition of Global Azure 2021 provided by the <i>Coding Club Linz</i>.

                <h3>We Are Virtual!</h3>

                <p class="text-faded">
                    The current Covid-situation does not allow us to invite you all to Linz (Austria).
                    Like last year, Global Azure 2021 will be a virtual event again. You can watch all sessions
                    on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingClubLinz" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, ask 
                    questions in comments, and join live discussions on 
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/FqQ22TG" target="_blank">Discord</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Everything Live!</h3>

                <p class="text-faded">
                    At Global Azure Austria, all sessions including live demos will be performed live.
                    Therefore, speakers can answer questions and interact with the audience during their talks.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h3>German and English Content</h3>

                <p class="text-faded">
                    The majority of our sessions will be in German. However, in order to offer content
                    for a broad audience, some speakers have agreed to deliver their sessions in English so
                    that people who do not understand German fluently can participate in the event, too.
                </p>

                <h3 class="join-us">Join us on Friday, April 16, 2021!</h3>
