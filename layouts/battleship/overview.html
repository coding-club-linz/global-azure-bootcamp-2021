                        In this coding contest, you can playfully enhance your coding skills
                        by building a computer player in a classical 
                        <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/BattleshipContestFunc/wiki/Game-Rules" target="_blank">Battleship</a>
                        game. The efficiency of your player will be measured automatically and you can 
                        see how well it performs in comparison to players of other contestants.

                    <hr>

                    <h3>When does it start? How long can I participate?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Currently, we are in <i>training mode</i>. You can develop players, you can upload them,
                        they will be measured. On April 16th, 2021, the day of the <i>Global Azure Austria 2021</i>
                        event, all results will be reset. Registered players will not be deleted, but you must
                        re-trigger a tournament in order to get measured and counted for the contest. The contest will
                        close after approx. two weeks (on May 3rd, 2021).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Which languages and platforms are supported?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Technically, a player is 
                        <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/BattleshipContestFunc/wiki/Player-Web-API" target="_blank"> web API</a>. 
                        As practically all modern languages and platforms support building web APIs, you can choose freely.
                        However, we have a 
                        <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/BattleshipContestFunc/wiki/.NET-Helper-Library" target="_blank">helper library</a> making it
                        particularly simple to using C# and .NET. Similar libraries for other languages might be added in the next weeks.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is this only for experienced developers?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        No. Even if you are a beginner in the programming platform of your choice, you
                        can participate. Building a player for the Battleship Coding Contest isn't
                        complicated and our
                        <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/BattleshipContestFunc/wiki/" target="_blank">documentation</a>
                        contains step-by-step tutorials for various programming languages.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Which cloud environments are supported?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        You can host your player 
                        <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/BattleshipContestFunc/wiki/Publishing-Local-Players" target="_blank">locally on your dev machine</a>
                        or in any cloud environment reachable from the public internet.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Do I need a server that is online 24x7?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                        Absolutely not. <em>You</em> trigger Battleship tournaments whenever you want, we store
                        your results, and your last result counts. Your player does not need to be continously available.
                    </p>
